📝 Tasks Performed
1. Load and Explore the Dataset
Loaded the dataset using pandas.read_csv()

Displayed the first few rows with .head()

Checked data types and missing values with .info() and .isnull().sum()

Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values

2. Basic Data Analysis
Computed basic statistics using .describe()

Grouped data by species and calculated mean values

Identified patterns and differences among species

3. Data Visualization
Created a line chart to show trends over samples

Generated a bar chart comparing average petal length per species

Plotted a histogram to understand the distribution of sepal width

Developed a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between sepal length and petal length

Customized plots with titles, axis labels, and legends

📈 Visualizations
The visualizations provide insights into the relationships between different features and how they vary across the three Iris species. For instance, the scatter plot reveals that setosa species have distinctly smaller petal lengths compared to versicolor and virginica.
